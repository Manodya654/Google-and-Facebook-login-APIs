               Know-Your-Neighborhood was founded in 2021 by a group of friends who found the traditional world of capital completely unrelatable.<br></br><br></br> Know-Your-Neighborhood We saw pictures of shirtless men with rippling ab muscles, some standing outside of storefronts coating you with cologne, with the message of The goal of this application is
to provide login/sign up using existing API. For this to happen, the application should have login
button with available APIs. <br></br>“if only you buy our clothes you can try to be as cool as we are” - and we were absolutely repelled.

At the same time, we saw that in the marketplace were getting longer and longer, with more and more fabric/pocketing/zip-ties & whoseewhatsits all over them. Where were the proper length men’s shorts that defined generations of shortsmen? Not only were shorts becoming completely unrecognizable, but they were also losing their personality, their craftsmanship. No one was focusing on this forgotten category of men’s apparel, when it’s a product that’s so vital to get right.

Finally, we founded the company in 2011, just 3 years after the financial crisis, 4 years after the launch of the first iPhone, and in the wake of the rapid rise of Facebook, Linkedin and other social networking apps. People were more stressed, comparing their lives to others on social media, and allowing work to overtake more and more of the work-life balance.

Enter Chubbies - our visceral and irreverent response to all of the above.<br></br>

We launched in September of 2011 and were sold out for 2+ years of our core casual shorts product.

In the subsequent years we launched swim t and quarter to round out the year-round Weekend Wardrobe.

Throughout, we maintained a consistent focus on building the perfect product for your Weekend, and wove every piece of fabric around that objective.

Now, we are proud to say we have the most well-rounded, custom-built-for-the-weekend apparel on the planet and, not only that, a brand built by, and for, our community and 100% centered on that Friday at 5pm feeling.
